Coffee.fund

The coffee.fund repository is for the contributors of coffee.fund who support not only the mission of 'good java, for good java' (or any other programming-to-coffee pun), but the development of a management system to serve as:

	-	An entry and record system for organizational coffee fund contributions.
	-	An entry and record system for organizational coffee fund inventory.
	-	A one-stop-shop for coffee fund managers to quickly order from a variety of 	online coffee distributors.
	-	A library of compiled coffee-related facts, figures, and surveys to keep 		coffee fund members informed on why the 'best part of waking up' is not 		Folgers in your cup.
	-	Aggregate data about coffee consumption and costs over time, preffered 			vendors, quality of vendors, and quality of coffee funds at organizations.

We are approaching critical mass in the organization for which the coffee.fund idea originates - a peak of principle in which we question the status quo of quality. We are asking the question 'What does this company do for us, for what we do for this company?' and more than not, we feel that quality is lacking.

Quality of life in question? Maybe... Quality of code in question? Possibly. Quality of our cup of coffee? Definitely.

More and more as a people we are weighing the costs of quality and costs, and we're ready to have something more than coffee concentrate, distilled forcefully and terribly from super-heated, super-cooled beans, sourced from a mass-production coffee farm, kept afloat by harsh fertilizers and chemicals.

We're pursuing small batches with great quality, we're valuing the 'little guy', the ma and pa shop, the small coffee-farm coffee growers around the world. We are behind a new wave of quality, not judged by only the cost, but the benefits we all receive collectively.

We are coffee.fund, and our mission is to provide a top-notch framework for coffee fund organizers to join this movement, and brew the good stuff.
